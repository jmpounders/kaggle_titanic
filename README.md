# Predicting survival on the Titanic (Kaggle competition)

This Jupyter notebook predicts survival onboard the Titanic based on features such as age, gender, travel companions, etc.  The data are from <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>.

At this point I have implemented logistic regression and random forrest models.  They both score about 77% accuracy on the Kaggle public leaderboard.  The logistic regression model is slightly ahead at a hair below 78% accuracy on the test data.  

The notebook is documented to some degree, but still a little "raw" at the sametime as I am still exploring...
